# Air, Land, & Sea — Complete Rules Reference

## Overview

Air, Land, & Sea is a two-player card game played over a series of rounds called **Battles**. Players compete to control three Theaters of war (Air, Land, and Sea) by playing cards strategically. The first player to accumulate **12 Victory Points (VPs)** wins the game.

---

## Game Components

- **3 Theater Boards:** Air, Land, Sea
- **18 Battle Cards:** 6 Air (gray), 6 Land (green), 6 Sea (blue)
- **2 Supreme Commander Cards:** 1st Player (red) and 2nd Player
- **14 Score Markers:** 2 Sixes, 6 Threes, 6 Ones

---

## Setup

1. Randomly place the three Theater boards in a row in any order.
2. Shuffle the two Supreme Commander cards and deal one facedown to each player. Flip them faceup. The player who receives the red Supreme Commander card (1st Player) takes the first turn.
3. Shuffle the remaining 18 Battle cards and deal 6 to each player. Hands are kept secret.
4. Place the remaining cards (the deck) to one side of the play area without revealing them.
5. Place all score tokens in a pile on the other side of the play area.

---

## Theaters

Each Theater board creates a "column" between the two players. Cards are always played into one of these three Theater columns.

- **Adjacent Theaters:** Theaters that are next to each other in the row are adjacent. The middle Theater is adjacent to both outer Theaters; the two outer Theaters are NOT adjacent to each other.
- **Ownership:** Each player owns all cards on their side of the Theater boards. You only play cards on your own side.

---

## Battle Cards

Each Battle card has the following properties:

### Strength
The large number on the card. If your total Strength in a Theater exceeds your opponent's total Strength in that Theater, you **control** that Theater.

### Type
Cards have one of three types, shown by color and icon:
- **Air** — Gray, airplane icon
- **Land** — Green, tank icon
- **Sea** — Blue, ship icon

Normally, a card played faceup must go to its matching Theater (Air cards to Air Theater, etc.).

### Tactical Ability
Most cards have a Tactical Ability printed on them. The ability activates immediately when the card is played faceup (or when a facedown card is flipped faceup). Abilities are either **Instant** or **Ongoing** (see Tactical Abilities section below).

### Facedown Cards
Any card can be played **facedown** as a "wild card" to **any** Theater. Facedown cards:
- Always have a Strength of **2** (regardless of their printed Strength).
- Do **not** activate their Tactical Ability.
- You may look at your own facedown cards at any time, but you may not look at your opponent's facedown cards.

### Covered and Uncovered Cards
When you play a card to a Theater where you already have cards, the new card is placed on top, partially overlapping (covering) your previous cards.
- A **covered card** is any card overlapped by another card.
- An **uncovered card** is the topmost card in a player's stack in a Theater (not overlapped by anything).

## Playing the Game — Resolving a Battle

Players alternate turns, starting with the 1st Player. **You do not draw cards during a Battle** — you must work with the 6 cards you were dealt.

On your turn, you must take exactly **one** of three actions:

### 1. Deploy
Play one card from your hand **faceup** to its matching Theater.

**Deployment restrictions:**
- You can only play cards on your side of the Theater boards.
- The card must match the Theater's type (Air card → Air Theater, etc.).
- If you already have cards in that Theater, the new card must be placed on top, covering your previous cards.
- Any Tactical Ability on the card takes effect immediately.

### 2. Improvise
Play one card from your hand **facedown** to **any** Theater.

- Facedown cards act as wild cards and ignore type restrictions.
- The card has a Strength of 2 (not its printed value).
- The card's Tactical Ability does not activate.

### 3. Withdraw
Concede the current Battle. Your opponent wins the Battle immediately but scores **fewer Victory Points** than they would if the Battle played out fully (see Scoring section).

**Strategy note:** Sometimes withdrawing early is the best move to limit the VPs your opponent gains.

After you complete your action, your opponent takes their turn. Players continue alternating until one player withdraws or both players have played all of their cards.

**Important:** You do NOT draw cards from the deck during a Battle unless a Tactical Ability specifically allows it.

---

## Tactical Abilities

Most cards have a Tactical Ability. The ability activates when the card is played faceup from hand, or when a facedown card is flipped faceup.

### Instant Abilities (lightning bolt icon)
- Take effect immediately when played/revealed.
- After resolving, the ability has no further effect (it's a one-time trigger).
- If multiple instant abilities trigger at the same time, resolve them in the order they occurred, fully completing each before moving to the next.
- Once an instant ability begins resolving, it always resolves fully, even if the card is flipped facedown during resolution.

### Ongoing Abilities (infinity symbol icon)
- Remain in effect as long as the card is **faceup**.
- If the card is flipped facedown, the ongoing ability immediately ceases. If it is later flipped faceup again, the ability reactivates.

### Mandatory vs. Optional
- You **must** carry out a Tactical Ability's effect unless the ability text includes the word "may."
- If a Tactical Ability is impossible to perform, it is simply ignored and has no effect.

---

## Tactical Ability Key Terms

### Flip
Turning a faceup card facedown, or a facedown card faceup. Unless the ability says otherwise, you may flip any card — yours or your opponent's.

### Uncovered / Covered
Many abilities only affect uncovered or covered cards. If an ability does not specify uncovered or covered, assume it can affect any card.

### Play
"Play" means taking a card from hand and placing it in a Theater. Unless otherwise specified, playing a card via an ability follows all normal rules: play on your own side, faceup cards go to their matching Theater, and the new card covers previous cards in that Theater.

### Non-Matching Theaters
If a card ends up in a Theater that doesn't match its type (due to a Tactical Ability), there is no penalty. The card stays where it is, and its Strength counts toward control of that Theater.

### Destroy
Destroyed cards are placed facedown on the bottom of the deck. If a card is destroyed immediately after being played (e.g., by Blockade), the destroyed card does not get to use its Tactical Ability.

### Occupied
Some abilities reference how many cards "occupy" a Theater. When counting, include both players' cards in that Theater.

### Move
Moving a card to a different Theater. When moved:
- The card stays on the same player's side.
- It is placed on top of any existing cards in the destination Theater (covering them).
- Moving is NOT the same as playing, so abilities that trigger on "play" do not trigger on "move."

## Ending a Battle

A Battle ends in one of two ways:

### 1. A Player Withdraws
The withdrawing player's opponent wins the Battle immediately.

### 2. Both Players Have Played All Cards
The player controlling the most Theaters wins the Battle.

**Controlling a Theater:**
- You control a Theater if your total Strength there is strictly higher than your opponent's.
- **Ties:** The 1st Player wins ties and controls the Theater.
- **Empty Theaters:** If neither player has any cards in a Theater, the 1st Player controls it.

---

## Scoring Victory Points

The number of VPs the winner earns depends on how the Battle ended:

### If Neither Player Withdrew (both played all cards)
The winner scores **6 VPs**.

### If a Player Withdrew
The non-withdrawing player scores VPs based on the **withdrawing player's Supreme Commander card**, which shows a chart relating the number of cards remaining in the withdrawing player's hand to the VPs awarded:

**1st Player withdraws (uses 1st Player Supreme Commander chart):**
| Cards left in hand | Opponent scores |
|-|-|
| 4+ | 2 VPs |
| 2–3 | 3 VPs |
| 1 | 4 VPs |
| 0 | 6 VPs |

**2nd Player withdraws (uses 2nd Player Supreme Commander chart):**
| Cards left in hand | Opponent scores |
|-|-|
| 5+ | 2 VPs |
| 3–4 | 3 VPs |
| 2 | 4 VPs |
| 0–1 | 6 VPs |

The key insight: the longer you wait to withdraw, the more VPs your opponent earns.

---

## Setting Up the Next Battle

After scoring, if neither player has reached 12 VPs:

1. Collect all 18 Battle cards, shuffle them, and deal 6 to each player. Set the rest aside as the deck.
2. **Rotate the Theater boards:** Shift all three boards one position in one direction (e.g., the leftmost board moves to the rightmost position, or vice versa — as indicated by the arrows in the rulebook).
3. **Exchange Supreme Commander cards.** The previous 1st Player becomes the 2nd Player, and vice versa.

---

## Winning the Game

After each Battle, check if the winner has reached **12 or more VPs**. If so, that player wins the war and the game. If not, set up and play another Battle.

---

## Beginner Mode (Optional)

For players learning the game, use simplified scoring:
- The winner of each Battle scores **1 VP** (regardless of withdrawal timing).
- The first player to reach **3 VPs** wins the game.
- Ignore the Withdraw chart on the Supreme Commander cards.

This mode lets new players focus on learning card abilities without worrying about the withdrawal VP system.
